CG Cookie RetopoFlow
====================

RetopoFlow is a suite of retopology tools for Blender built by [CG Cookie](https://cgcookie.com).
The tools are offered as add-on for Blender that provides a dedicated set of mesh tools designed specifically for retopology, creating a complete workflow in Blender without the need for outside applications.

RetopoFlow includes several tools, all of which automatically snap the resulting mesh to the target object surface.
All mesh generation is quad-based (unless you explicitly create other ngons) and tools are modal.


# Getting RetopoFlow

You may purchase RetopoFlow on the [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/retopoflow/)

Purchasing a copy entitles you to tool support and helps ensure RetopoFlows continued development.


## Getting Support

You can get support for tools by sending a message to CG Cookie on your [Blender Market Inbox](https://blendermarket.com/inbox).

A valid purchase is required for product support.

:warning:
While it is permissible to grab a copy of RetopoFlow from GitHub, this method is recommended for developers only, because it can get technical.
If you have issues with enabling the add-on after installing RetopoFlow using this method, please make sure that you have installed RetopoFlow _correctly_ before creating an issue.
Alternatively, you can purchase a copy from the [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/retopoflow), and you will get full support along with a packaged version of RetopoFlow.


## Releases

In addition to the [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/retopoflow), all releases of RetopoFlow are accessible from the [GitHub RetopoFlow Releases](https://github.com/CGCookie/retopoflow/releases).
Simply download the appropriate attached zip (_NOT_ the Source Code!), then install as Blender add-on (Blender > Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...).


# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!
If you'd like to contribute to the project then simply fork the repo, work on your changes, and then submit a pull request.
