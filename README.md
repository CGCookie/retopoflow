CG Cookie RetopoFlow
==========

RetopoFlow is a suite of retopology tools for Blender built by [CG Cookie](http://cgcookie.com). The tools are offered as add-on for Blender that provides a dedicated set of mesh tools designed specifically for retopology, creating a complete workflow in Blender without the need for outside applications.

RetopoFlow includes several tools, all of which automatically snap the resulting mesh to the target object surface. All mesh generation is quad-based and tools are modal.
