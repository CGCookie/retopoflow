- adjusting ps segment count on thin surfaces causes problems [screencap](https://cl.ly/mNg5)
- adjusting ps segment count can sometimes split strip in two, preventing changing count further
- adjusting counts push to undo stack multiple times
- undo stack actions should be more informative (for instrumentation)
- integrate edge-patches
- symmetry along y and z

- PP: quad from three verts??
- tweak connected
- turning on symmetry should snap/merge target geo on other side?
- button to snap target to source
- settings need to be saved between sessions
- polypen crashes (trying to create edge between verts that have edge?)
- dissolve edges, verts, faces, etc in pp

- "add edge loops with something like loop cut"
- reimplement f2
    - fill in gap between strips with single button
- work in blender 2.8
- update blender button tooltips
- snap merge upon move
- deselect in PS?
- change radius of strip, similar to segment count
