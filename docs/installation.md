## Installing

The easiest way to install Retopoflow is to do so directly within Blender.
You can do this by going to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons. Go to the dropdown arrow on the top right of the editor and choose Install From Disk.
This will open the File Browser in Blender, allowing to you navigate to and select the zip file you downloaded.
Press Install From Disk.

_If your browser auto-extracted the downloaded zip file, then you will need to re-compress the **retopoflow** folder before installing, or use Save As to save the zip file without extracting the contents._

Once installed, Blender should automatically filter the list of add-ons to show only Retopoflow.
You can then enable the add-on by clicking the checkbox next to `Retopoflow 4`.

If you have any issues with installing, please try the following steps:

1. Download the latest version of Retopoflow for your version of Blender (see requirements section above).
2. Open Blender
3. Head to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons and search for Retopoflow
4. Expand by clicking the triangle, and then press Uninstall
5. Close Blender to completely clear out the previous version
6. Open Blender and head to Preferences again
7. Go to the top right dropdown and click Install From Disk
8. Navigate to your Retopoflow zip file (again, do not unzip)
9. Click Install From Disk
10. Enable Retopoflow

If you're still experiencing any issues with starting Retopoflow, please try going to File > Defaults > Restore Factory Defaults and then enabling Retopoflow. This will help us rule out conflicts with other add-ons and custom settings.
