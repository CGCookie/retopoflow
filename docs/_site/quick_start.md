# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with RetopoFlow {{ site.data.options.rf_version }}.

## The Short, Short Version

To start retopologizing for the first time:

1. Switch to Object mode
2. Go to Add > Mesh
3. Either click "Retopology at Cursor" or "Retopology at Active"

    - "at Cursor" will create a new retopology mesh located at the 3D Cursor and oriented to the world.
    - "at Active" will create a new retopology mesh located at and oriented to the active object.

Or, you can create a new retopology object yourself, enter edit mode on it, and switch to any of the RetopoFlow tools in the toolbar.

To continue working on a previous retopology session:

1. Select the low-poly retopology mesh
2. Switch to Edit Mode
3. Switch to one of the RetopoFlow tools in the toolbar

Enjoy!
