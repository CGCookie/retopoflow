# Welcome!

Retopoflow is a suite of fun, sketch-based retopology tools for Blender, created by [Orange Turbine](https://orangeturbine.com), that generate geometry which snaps to your high poly objects as you draw on their surface.

You can read about the features and purchase a copy on [Superhive](https://blendermarket.com/products/retopoflow/) (formerly Blender Market).

If youâ€™re brand new to Retopoflow, check the [Quick Start page](quick_start.html).

Another great place to learn the tools is our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@orangeturbine).

## Versions 1-3

Retopoflow has been completely refactored in version 4, and this documentation has been updated to match. For information on how to use the previous versions, please refer to the in-app documentation using the version you have. 

Even though we will not be adding new featues to it, Retopoflow 3 will still be supprted for at least two years after the official launch of 4.0.
