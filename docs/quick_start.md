# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with RetopoFlow {{ site.data.options.rf_version }}.

## The Short, Short Version

To start retopologizing in Blender after installing Retopoflow:

1. Go to Add > Mesh in Object mode
2. Either click "Retopology at Cursor" or "Retopology at Active"

    - "at Cursor" will create a new retopology object located at the 3D Cursor and oriented to the world.
    - "at Active" will create a new retopology object located at and oriented to the active object.

You can also create a new retopology object yourself or select an existing retopology object, enter Edit Mode on it, and switch to any of the RetopoFlow tools in the toolbar.

Enjoy!
