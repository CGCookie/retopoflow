# ![](polystrips-icon.png) PolyStrips Help

Shortcut: {{polystrips tool}}


The PolyStrips tool provides quick and easy ways to map out key face loops for complex models.
For example, if you need to retopologize a human face, creature, or any other complex organic or hard-surface object.

PolyStrips works by hand drawing strokes on to the high-resolution source object.
The strokes are instantly converted into spline-based strips of polygons.

Any continuous quad strip may be manipulated with PolyStrips via the auto-generated spline handles.
