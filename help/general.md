# General Help

Help Shortcut: {{general help}}

When RetopoFlow Mode is enabled, certain shortcuts are available regardless of the tool selected.
For tool-specific help, select the tool from the Tools panel, and either press {{tool help}} or click Tool Help.

View the [table of contents](table_of_contents.md) for all built-in documentation by pressing {{all help}} at any time.

Below is a brief description of some of the features in RetopoFlow.
For more details, see the tooltips when hovering or the product documentation page.

| {{reveal hidden}}                     | : | reveal hidden geometry |
| {{action}}                            | : | transform selection when mouse hovers selected geometry |
| {{grab}}                              | : | grab and move selected geometry |
| {{rotate}}                            | : | rotate selected geometry |
| {{scale}}                             | : | scale selected geometry |
| {{smooth edge flow}}                  | : | smooths edge flow of selected geometry |
| {{delete}}                            | : | delete / dissolve dialog |
| {{delete pie menu}}                   | : | delete / dissolve pie menu

Pressing {{delete}} will bring up the Delete/Dissolve dialog, allowing you to delete/dissolve the selected geometry.
Pressing and holding {{delete pie menu}} will bring up a Delete/Dissolve pie menu, which has fewer options than the dialog but is generally faster.

## General Options

The UI Scale option controls how large or small RetopoFlow will draw things.
Larger numbers produce larger fonts, thicker lines, larger vertices, etc.

If the Auto Hide Tool Options is checked, the options for the currently selected tool will be shown, but all other tool options will be hidden.

<!-- The Maximize Area button will make the 3D view take up the entire Blender window, similar to pressing `Ctrl+Up` / `Shift+Space` / `Alt+F10`. -->




### Target Cleaning

The Snap Verts buttons will snap either All vertices or only Selected vertices to the nearest point on the source meshes.

The Merge by Distance will merge vertices into a single vertex if they are within a given distance.




### View Options

The Clipping options control the near and far clipping planes.

The Theme option changes the color of selected geometry.

The Target Drawing options control the rendering of the target mesh.
The Above and Below options control transparency of the target mesh.
Vertex Size and Edge Size control how large the vertices and how think the edges are.






## Symmetry Options

The X, Y, Z checkboxes turn on/off symmetry or mirroring along the X, Y, Z axes.
Note: symmetry utilizes the mirror modifier.

When symmetry is turned on, the mirroring planes can be visualized on the sources choosing either the Edge or Face option.
The Effect setting controls the strength of the visualization.
