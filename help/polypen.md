# PolyPen Help ![](polypen_32.png width:32px;height:32px;padding:0px)

Shortcut: {{polypen tool}}


The PolyPen tool provides absolute control for creating complex topology on a vertex-by-vertex basis (e.g., low-poly game models).
This tool lets you insert vertices, extrude edges, fill faces, and transform the subsequent geometry all within one tool and in just a few clicks.

## Tips

Creating vertices/edges/faces is dependent on your selection:

- When nothing is selected, a new vertex is added.
- When a single vertex is selected, an edge is added between mouse and selected vertex.
- When an edge is selected, a triangle is added between mouse and selected edge.
- When a triangle is selected, a vertex is added to the triangle, turning the triangle into a quad

Selecting an edge and clicking onto another edge will create a quad in one step.

The PolyPen tool can be used like a knife, cutting vertices into existing edges for creating new topology routes.
