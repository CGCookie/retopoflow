The Strokes tool helps fill in holes in your topology.
This tool lets you insert edge strips and extruding edges by brushing a stroke on the source.

## Tips

Creating geometry is dependent on your selection:

- When nothing is selected, a new edge strip is added
- When an edge strip is selected and stroke is not a loop, the selected edge strip is extruded to the stroke
- When an edge loop is selected and stroke is a loop, the selected edge loop is extruded to the stroke

Note: only edges on boundary of target are considered in selection.

If stroke starts or ends on existing vertex, the Strokes tool will try to bridge the extruded geometry.
